As a passionate bilingual Front End/ Full Stack Developer of British and Uruguayan descent, I am deeply committed to advancing my expertise in the field of technology. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computing from Arden University, I strive to continually enhance my knowledge and skills. My educational journey includes graduating from The Code Institute in Full Stack Software Development, where I specialized in advanced Front End with REACT. Additionally, I completed the DFE fully funded Software Engineer Skills Bootcamp by Hyperion Dev, focusing on Python, SQL, Object-Oriented Programming, data structures, database programming, algorithms, and machine learning.

In my current role as a Front End Developer at Outset, I am dedicated to facilitating the successful launch of their second prototype application. Utilizing technologies such as Vue.js, Ionic Frameworks, JavaScript, and Typescript, I contribute to Outset's mission of seamlessly integrating wellness into everyday life through advanced analytics of weather, availability, patterns, and preferences. This analysis optimally schedules activities, maximizing their mind-boosting effects. 

Previously, as a Web Developer at London Lash, I led the successful launch of 3 new Shopify E-Commerce websites and managed a diverse portfolio of 13 sites. My expertise extends to designing numerous landing pages using HTML, CSS, and Liquid, while my proficiency in JavaScript and jQuery ensures efficient coding. My experience has honed my ability to troubleshoot bugs effectively and manage additional workloads. At the Grae Matta Foundation, I contributed to the development of a website promoting mental health standards in educational and professional settings, deepening my commitment to leveraging technology for well-being. My diverse experiences, including involvement with organizations like Anahata Foundation, Paula Parral Akashic Records, and Vell Magazine, have equipped me to thrive in dynamic start-up and small business environments.

I was driven by my inquisitive nature, and the prospect of combining technology with health & wellness. I believe that developing software is a fundamental tool for us, and it is my dream to work on this amazing technology.
